There is a vitality, a life force ,an energy , a quickening that translates through you into action and because there's only one of you in all of time, it is unique. If you block it, it will not exist in any other medium and it will be lost, The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine if it is good or if it is valuable or how it compares to any other expression. It is your business to keep it yours, clearly and directly and to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself and your work, you just have to stay open and aware to the urges that motivate you to keep the channel open , and part of the work of keeping the channel open is to show up day after day after day at a room of your own or a corner of your own where you can pursue your obsessions
